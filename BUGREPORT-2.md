**API Testing General Bug Report Summary**

* **Summary:** Several issues have been identified during API testing, indicating potential weaknesses in authentication, response validation, and error handling.
* **Overview of Findings:**
  * **Authentication Issue:**
    * No authentication is required for API requests. This may be intentional for a learning API but presents a security risk in production scenarios.

  * **Duplicate ID Handling:**
    * **Endpoint:** POST `/pet`
    * **Issue:** Posting a pet with the same ID twice results in overwriting the existing pet instead of returning an error about duplicate IDs.

  * **Inconsistent Response for Pet Creation:**
    * **Endpoint:** POST `/pet/{petId}`
    * **Response Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "code": 200,
        "type": "unknown",
        "message": "1"
      }
      ```
    * **Issue:** The response does not align with expected API response standards, as the "type" is labeled as "unknown" and the "message" is unclear.

  * **Access-Control-Allow-Methods Header Misconfiguration:**
    * **Issue:** All endpoints return the following in response headers:
      ```
      access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
      ```
    * **Expected Result:** Only the CRUD methods relevant to the specific endpoint should be allowed.

  * **Incorrect Status Codes for Deleted Pets:**
    * **Endpoint:** GET `/pet/{petId}` (for deleted pet)
    * **Response Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "code": 1,
        "type": "error",
        "message": "Pet not found"
      }
      ```
    * **Issue:** Although the message "Pet not found" is correct, the status code returned is 200 (OK) instead of a 404 (Not Found).

  * **Inconsistent Deletion Response:**
    * **Endpoint:** DELETE `/pet/{petId}`
    * **Response Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "code": 200,
        "type": "unknown",
        "message": "100"
      }
      ```
    * **Issue:** The response returns unclear message values, and the response type is labeled as "unknown."

  * **Invalid Data Acceptance:**
    * **Issue:** Pets can be created with invalid data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect types) and still receive a 200 response instead of a validation error.

* **Impact:**
  * **Security:** Lack of authentication can expose sensitive operations.
  * **Data Integrity:** Duplicate ID handling and acceptance of invalid data can result in inconsistent data.
  * **User Experience:** Confusing responses and misaligned status codes reduce API usability and can lead to incorrect assumptions by developers.

* **Recommendations:**
  1. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  2. Enforce unique constraints on pet IDs and provide meaningful error responses.
  3. Update status codes to align with HTTP standards (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
  4. Configure access control headers to only allow relevant HTTP methods per endpoint.
  5. Add stricter validation for data formats and required fields.

* **Next Steps:** Review and update API specifications to align with RESTful standards, update automated tests to include validation for expected responses, and re-test after implementation of fixes.

### Jira API Bug Reports

**DRNSHLD 20001: Missing Authentication Mechanism**  
* **Summary:** No authentication is required for API requests. 

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Send any API request without authentication.  
* **Expected Result:** API should require valid authentication.  
* **Actual Result:** Requests are processed without authentication.  

---

**DRNSHLD 20002: Duplicate Pet ID Handling**  
* **Summary:** Duplicate pet IDs result in data overwrites. 

**Severity:** VERY HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. POST a new pet with a unique ID.  
  2. POST another pet with the same ID.  
* **Expected Result:** API should return an error indicating a duplicate ID.  
* **Actual Result:** The existing pet is overwritten without an error.  

---

**DRNSHLD 20003: Inconsistent Pet Creation Response**  
* **Summary:** The API returns unclear responses for pet creation. 

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Send a POST request to `/pet/{petId}`.  
  2. Observe the response.  
* **Expected Result:** A clear, descriptive response (e.g., success message with created pet details).  
* **Actual Result:** The response shows "unknown" type and a vague message.  

---

**DRNSHLD 20004: Misconfigured Access-Control-Allow-Methods Header**  
* **Summary:** The response headers allow all CRUD methods regardless of endpoint.  

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Send a request to any endpoint.  
  2. Check the "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" header.  
* **Expected Result:** Header should allow only relevant HTTP methods for the endpoint.  
* **Actual Result:** All CRUD methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) are allowed.  

---

**DRNSHLD 20005: Incorrect Status Code for Deleted Pet**  
* **Summary:** Status code 200 is returned for a deleted pet instead of 404.  

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. DELETE a pet.  
  2. Attempt a GET request for the deleted pet.  
* **Expected Result:** Response status should be 404 (Not Found).  
* **Actual Result:** Response status is 200 (OK).  

---

**DRNSHLD 20006: Inconsistent Deletion Response Message**  
* **Summary:** Deletion response includes unclear values. 

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Send a DELETE request to `/pet/{petId}`.  
  2. Observe the response.  
* **Expected Result:** Clear success message indicating deletion.  
* **Actual Result:** Response message shows an ambiguous value (e.g., "100").  

---

**DRNSHLD 20007: Invalid Data Accepted in Pet Creation**  
* **Summary:** Invalid pet data is accepted during creation.  

**Severity:** HIGH

* **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Send a POST request to `/pet` with missing or incorrect fields.  
* **Expected Result:** API should return a validation error.  
* **Actual Result:** Request is processed with a 200 response.
